Given an array A of size N , check if there exist any pair of index i,j such that Ai=Aj and i?j
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers Ai.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing answer "Yes" or "No" (without quotes).

Constraints
1=T=100
2=N=105
1=Ai=109
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

2=N=100
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Example Input
2
4
1 2 1 3
5
5 4 1 2 3
